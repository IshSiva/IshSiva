### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Ishwarya Sivakumar, a first year MSCS-Machine Learning specialization student at Georgia Tech. I am passionate about solving real-world problems using the tools of Computer Science. I became interested in Machine Learning because of it's potential to revolutionize the way we approach complex problems and make data-driven decisions. 

In the field of Machine Learning, I am particularly interested in Natural Language Processing and GraphML. I have also worked on projects related to Computer Vision. I am proficient in Python, PyTorch and in using ML libraries like NumPy, Pandas and Scikit-Learn. I have working experience with TensorFlow, Django, Flask, Java and Spring Boot. 

My GitHub profile presents a compilation of projects that I have worked on in the last 5 years as a part of my coursework, research or internships. These projects span across different domains in ML, such as NLP, GraphML and Vision. In addition to this, there are projects in Web and Android App development.

When I am not working on CS-related stuff, I love reading books, playing chess and listening to music. I am also a big fan of TV sitcoms like Brooklyn Nine-Nine and F.R.I.E.N.D.S.
